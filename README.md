We are given a dataset which consists of monthly totals of international airline passengers, from 1949 to 1960. We will be following an ARIMA modelling procedure of the AirPassengers dataset as follows:

1. Perform exploratory data analysis
2. Decomposition of data
3. Test the stationarity
4. Fit a model using the ARIMA algorithm
5. Calculate forecasts.
